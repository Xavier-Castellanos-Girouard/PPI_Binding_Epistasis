# This Directory contains all the primary datasets directly taken from literature.

# The following files are too large for storage on GitHub:
Genetic_Interactions/SGA_ExE.txt
Genetic_Interactions/SGA_ExN_NxE.txt
Genetic_Interactions/SGA_NxN.txt
Mass_Spectrometry_Interactomes/preprocessedProteinDataForCorrelation.txt

# The SGA data can be downloaded from:
https://thecellmap.org/costanzo2016/ 
(Choose Matrix Format)

# The Mass Spectrometry Data was requested directly from the authors of Michaelis et al. 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06739-5)

# The contents of the following directory for the PDBbind database were also too heavy:
PDBbind_vs2020/PDB_files/

# This can be downloaded from the PDBbind website: http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/download.php
# The "Protein-protein complexes" dataset from PDBbind v2020 was used.
